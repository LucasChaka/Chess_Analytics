# Chess Analytics 1.0: Data Analytics to Enhance Chess Skills

## Introduction (to be edited in the end)

As a passionate chess lover and data enthusiast, I set out on an exciting mission: to use the power of data analytics to boost my game. Fueled by my desire for more wins, I dove into my gaming history, searching for patterns and insights that could give me an edge. Now, join me as I unveil the results of my analysis, revealing how data-driven strategies can transform chess play into victory. In this analysis, I delve into the fascinating world of chess through the lens of data analytics. My goal? To uncover hidden patterns and strategic insights within my gameplay history that could elevate my performance on the board. With a keen eye for detail and a thirst for victory, I explore the depths of my gaming data to unlock secrets that can sharpen my tactical acumen and lead to more triumphs. 

Exploring open data is like diving into a treasure trove, and chess.com offers a myriad of options to tap into that wealth. One avenue is downloading data from your archives in a PGN format. Yet, amidst the sea of information, navigating through the clutter can be a challenge. Enter [chessinsights.xyz](https://chessinsights.xyz/), a beacon of simplicity and utility in the vast ocean of chess data. Crafted by a fellow chess enthusiast, whom I am not affiliated with yet respect for the skills he put into such a web application, this website not only streamlines the analysis process but also provides access to raw data for further exploration. It's a testament to the power of community-driven tools, making complex analysis a breeze.

Therefore, leveraging PostgreSQL, R, and Python, I've curated the insights presented in this report, delving into the intricacies of my chess journey. My aim is to decipher the factors influencing my win rate and unearth actionable insights to refine my future gameplay strategies. Through meticulous analysis and a data-driven approach, I endeavor to enhance my understanding of the game dynamics and pave the path toward continued improvement.

## All about the data

The data exported to a csv file from [chessinsights.xyz](https://chessinsights.xyz/) contains the following columns (I call it columns for now as its a raw data not yet extracted, transformmed nor loaded):

The raw data includes the following columns:
userAccuracy	opponentAccuracy	gameUrl	gameId	timeClass	fen	userColor	userRating	opponent	opponentRating	opponentUrl	result	wonBy	date	openingUrl	opening	startTime	endTime	outcome	moveCount

- userAccuracy: Accuracy of the player
- opponentAccuracy: Accuracy of the opponent
- gameURL: reference to the specific game played
- gameID: reference to the game ID
- timeClass: the type of game, whether its rapid (a 10-minute long game), blitz (a 3-minute long game) or bullet (a 1-minute long game)
- userColor: the color the player Played

For reference on how it is calculated, please refer to [chess.com/ratings](https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-ratings#:~:text=The%20Glicko%20system%E2%80%94used%20on,when%20calculating%20each%20player's%20rating.) For your reference, the greatest chess player of all time, Magnus Carlsen, is rated 2830 as of March 1st, 2024. I was rated 962 in the same day. So you can imaging the performance difference.

However the raw data is just a complete mess, that I needed to transform. 

According to [chess.com/accuracy_blog](https://support.chess.com/article/1135-what-is-accuracy-in-analysis-how-is-it-measured#:~:text=Your%20Accuracy%20is%20a%20measurement,as%20determined%20by%20the%20engine.), Your accuracy is a measurement of how closely you played to what the computer has determined to be the best possible play against your opponent's specific moves. The closer you are to 100, the closer you are to 'perfect' play, as determined by the engine.
