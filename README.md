# Chess Data Analytics: Enhancing chess skills through data analysis(in progress)

## Introduction (to be edited in the end)

A lot of people who know the rules of chess but don't really play it much think that you win chess solely by focusing on how the pieces move tactically. However, chess encompasses much more than that. Opening theories, for instance, can lead to swift victories, with some resulting in as few as three moves (such as the scholar's mate). The middle game, once both players have positioned their pieces for later attacks, involves numerous tactics and strategies, ranging from basic ones like skewers, forks, and pins to more advanced techniques like zugzwang, and so forth. These tactics can ultimately determine the outcome of the endgame, which may have been anticipated by both players, one player, or neither.

A strong opening can pave the way for a strong middle game or endgame. Additionally, the end game, in turn, also depends on the knowledge of the player, focus at the time of play, and other factors that may or may not be noticed at the time of play. However, achieving a positive endgame result (a win) often requires meticulous analysis of each game in the hope of improving future ones. Such analyses require a careful overview of each game played: What mistakes were made? Which moves were good or efficient? This preparation is crucial for the next game. But what about a macro analysis, where it's possible to review all the games played thus far, holistically? This would involve examining which openings have been advantageous for the player, what openings opponents of the player's caliber typically employ, player's strengths, weaknesses, strongest opponents, and so on. This comprehensive review can guide the player in understanding their style of play, areas of improvement, which openings to practice, what their top opponents did best, and much more.

In theory, obtaining such data might be challenging, as most games occur over the board without any formal recording, except perhaps at the professional level where players document each move. While this method is ideal for studying chess greats like Gary Kasparov or Magnus Carlsen, it offers only a micro or individual analysis of games played by others, not necessarily at the beginner or intermediate level. However, in recent years, particularly after the Netflix limited series "The Queen's Gambit," chess, especially online chess, has surged in popularity, leading to a significant increase in subscribers on platforms like [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) and [lichess.org](https://lichess.org). With such subscription increment, comes a system where every game is recorded, providing detailed insights into each move and overall gameplay.

[chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) offers such opportunities through a PGN format. Moreover, there has been increasing emphasis on chess data, with web applications such as [chessinsights.xyz](https://chessinsights.xyz/) created by chess enthusiast web developers and data scientists, offering raw data on all games played, streamlining the messy nature of PGN files. This analytics report aims to provide insights into a single player's gameplay, facilitating improvements from a macro and holistic perspective. 

Disclaimer: For privacy purposes, the username of the player will not be reported here. However, analysts looking to conduct a thorough macro analysis of their own or other players can download the required data from [chessinsights.xyz](https://chessinsights.xyz/). For the remainder of the analysis, this report assigns the pseudonym *John* to the player being analyzed.
