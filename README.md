# Chess Data Analytics: Enhancing chess skills through data analysis(in progress)

## Introduction (to be edited in the end)

Many individuals who grasp the rules of chess but don't engage in it frequently believe that winning solely hinges on tactical maneuvering. However, chess encompasses far more than mere tactics. Opening theories, for example, can lead to swift victories, some unfolding in as few as three moves (such as the scholar's mate). The middle game, after players have strategically positioned their pieces, involves a plethora of tactics and strategies, ranging from basic skewers, forks, and pins to more intricate techniques like zugzwang. These maneuvers often dictate the outcome of the endgame, which may have been foreseen by both players, one, or neither.

A strong opening sets the stage for a robust middle game or endgame. Furthermore, the endgame itself relies heavily on the player's knowledge, focus, and other factors, whether acknowledged at the time or not. However, achieving a favorable endgame result often demands meticulous analysis of each game, aiming to enhance future performance. Such scrutiny involves a detailed review: identifying errors, evaluating effective moves, and preparing for subsequent matches. But what about a macro analysis, which offers a holistic review of all games played by one individual instead of one specific game? This comprehensive approach includes examining all advantageous openings used, common strategies among opponents of similar caliber, as well as the player's strengths, weaknesses, and noteworthy opponents.

While obtaining such data may pose a challenge, particularly with most games occurring without formal recording, recent years, especially post Netflix's limited series, "The Queen's Gambit", have witnessed a surge in chess's popularity, particularly online. Platforms like [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) and [lichess.org](https://lichess.org) have seen significant subscription increases, resulting in detailed game recordings and insights. [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) provides opportunities through a PGN format, while web applications such as [chessinsights.xyz](https://chessinsights.xyz/) offer raw data, streamlining analysis processes. This report aims to delve into a player's gameplay, offering macro and holistic perspectives for improvement.

However, individual player analyses have inherent limitations; for instance, the range of chess openings is constrained to the player under scrutiny. Yet, leveraging data from top chess masters can broaden the analytical scope.

## Methodology
                      3.	Methodology
                      •	Describe the methods and techniques used for data collection and analysis.
                      •	Explain any assumptions made and limitations encountered during the analysis.
### Data Collection

The data utilized in this analysis primarily originates from [chessinsights.xyz](https://chessinsights.xyz/), a web application designed for chess enthusiasts and data scientists. Users can input a specific username registered on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) to access a comprehensive list of raw data alongside a limited set of visualizations tailored for analytical purposes. These data sets encapsulate a history of live chess games played across different geographical regions or among friends, providing valuable insights into players' performance. It's worth noting that alternative platforms such as [lichess.org](https://lichess.org) also offer similar data accessibility.

Initially, two sets of data were downloaded in CSV format: the raw data and a relatively cleaner version, which in the following report will be refered to as the *explorable data*. While the raw data offers a wealth of information and variables, its presentation can be somewhat messy. Conversely, the cleaner dataset, though less extensive, is more organized and easier to navigate. However, it's essential to recognize that certain variables available in the cleaner dataset may not be present in the raw data. Thus, to ensure comprehensive analysis, it's advisable to leverage both datasets in tandem.

The data exported to a CSV file from [chessinsights.xyz](https://chessinsights.xyz/) encompasses various columns (referred to as such for now, as the data is raw and has not yet undergone any ETL processes).
