# Chess Data Analytics: Enhancing chess skills through data analysis(in progress)

## Introduction (to be edited in the end)

A lot of people who know the rules of chess but don't really play it much think that you win chess solely by focusing on how the pieces move tactically. However, chess encompasses much more than that. Opening theories, for instance, can lead to swift victories, with some resulting in as few as three moves (such as the scholar's mate). The middle game, once both players have positioned their pieces for later attacks, involves numerous tactics and strategies, ranging from basic ones like skewers, forks, and pins to more advanced techniques like zugzwang, and so forth. These tactics can ultimately determine the outcome of the endgame, which may have been anticipated by both players, one player, or neither.

A strong opening can pave the way for a strong middle game or endgame. Additionally, the end game, in turn, also depends on the knowledge of the player, focus at the time of play, and other factors that may or may not be noticed at the time of play. However, achieving a positive endgame result (a win) often requires meticulous analysis of each game in the hope of improving future ones. Such analyses require a careful overview of each game played: What mistakes were made? Which moves were good or efficient? This preparation is crucial for the next game. But what about a macro analysis, where it's possible to review all the games played thus far, holistically? This would involve examining which openings have been advantageous for the player, what openings opponents of the player's caliber typically employ, player's strengths, weaknesses, strongest opponents, and so on. This comprehensive review can guide the player in understanding their style of play, areas of improvement, which openings to practice, what their top opponents did best, and much more.

In theory, obtaining such data might be challenging, as most games occur over the board without any formal recording, except perhaps at the professional level where players document each move. While this method is ideal for studying chess greats like Gary Kasparov or Magnus Carlsen, it offers only a micro or individual analysis of games played by others, not necessarily at the beginner or intermediate level. However, in recent years, particularly after the Netflix limited series "The Queen's Gambit," chess, especially online chess, has surged in popularity, leading to a significant increase in subscribers on platforms like [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) and [lichess.org](https://lichess.org). With such subscription increment, comes a system where every game is recorded, providing detailed insights into each move and overall gameplay.

[chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) offers such opportunities through a PGN format. Moreover, there has been increasing emphasis on chess data, with web applications such as [chessinsights.xyz](https://chessinsights.xyz/) created by chess enthusiast web developers and data scientists, offering raw data on all games played, streamlining the messy nature of PGN files. This analytics report aims to provide insights into a single player's gameplay, facilitating improvements from a macro and holistic perspective. Nonetheless, a single player's analysis has its own limitations. For instance, the number of chess openings used will be limited to the player being analyzed. However, an additional analysis based on the following report can be constructed by analyzing the data of the top 10 chess masters and what chess enthusiasts can learn from them.

Disclaimer: For privacy purposes, the username of the player will not be reported here. However, analysts looking to conduct a thorough macro analysis of their own or other players can download the required data from [chessinsights.xyz](https://chessinsights.xyz/). For the remainder of the analysis, this report assigns the pseudonym *John* to the player being analyzed.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The data used in the following analysis was mainly collected from [chessinsights.xyz](https://chessinsights.xyz/). [chessinsights.xyz](https://chessinsights.xyz/) is a web application where individuals can put in a specific user name registered in [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) and get a full list of raw data and a small amount of visualizations for analysis purpose. The data downloaded are a history of live chess game plays played through two players from different parts of the world or among friends. Hence, *John*'s live chess game data.  Here to note is that, there are also other platforms such as [lichess.org](https://lichess.org), where one can get data on a player's game play.
Two data were initially downloaded in a csv format, a raw data and a relatively cleaner raw data. The differences between the two are, the raw data conains so much more redundant information than the explorable data yet at the same time has no information loaded in some of the most important columns for analysis. 



For example, the column *result* doesn't show the win, loss or draw but shows the outcome of the game without specifying who checkmated who, who resigned and so on. That is something, that should be extracted by treating the two data as relational data. 





Sources: The data used in this analysis was collected from [specify sources, e.g., Chess.com API, internal databases].
Scope: The dataset comprises [describe the scope of the data, e.g., chess game records] spanning from [start date] to [end date].
Variables: The main variables included in the dataset are [list key variables, e.g., game outcome, opening moves, player ratings].
Preprocessing: Before analysis, the data underwent preprocessing steps to [describe any data cleaning, transformation, or normalization procedures].
Analysis Techniques:
Descriptive Analysis: Initial exploration of the dataset involved descriptive statistics to summarize the characteristics and distributions of the variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA techniques, such as data visualization and summary statistics, were employed to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
Statistical Analysis: Various statistical tests, including [specify tests, e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests], were conducted to investigate relationships between variables and test hypotheses.
Machine Learning Models: Machine learning algorithms, such as [specify algorithms, e.g., logistic regression, decision trees], were utilized for predictive modeling or classification tasks.
Software and Tools:
Programming Languages: The analysis was performed using [specify programming languages, e.g., R, Python] for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Statistical Packages: Statistical packages such as [specify packages, e.g., pandas, scikit-learn] were utilized for conducting statistical analyses and building machine learning models.
Visualization Tools: Visualization tools such as [specify tools, e.g., Matplotlib, ggplot2] were employed to create visualizations for interpreting and presenting the results.
Assumptions and Limitations:
Assumptions: Certain assumptions were made during the analysis, including [list any assumptions, e.g., normality of data distribution, independence of observations].
Limitations: The analysis is subject to certain limitations, such as [describe any limitations, e.g., data quality issues, sample size constraints], which may impact the generalizability of the findings.
Ethical Considerations:
Data Privacy: Measures were taken to ensure data privacy and confidentiality, adhering to [specify relevant data privacy regulations, e.g., GDPR, HIPAA].
Bias and Fairness: Efforts were made to mitigate bias and ensure fairness in the analysis, including [describe steps taken, e.g., algorithmic fairness checks, bias detection methods].
Validation and Verification:
Validation: The results of the analysis were validated through [describe validation procedures, e.g., cross-validation, sensitivity analysis] to assess the robustness and reliability of the findings.
Verification: The analysis process was verified through [specify verification methods, e.g., peer review, code review] to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.
This methodology outlines the approach and procedures followed in conducting the analysis, providing transparency and clarity to the reader.
